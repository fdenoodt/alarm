![image-20200822155035922](readme/image-20200822155035922.png)

Special alarm that works with image recognition. When it is time to get up, the camera will detect if you are still in bed. If yes, the alarm will continue until you get out of bed. If you go out of bed the alarm stops. When you get back to bed the alarm will go off again.

The goal of this project is to wake people up without a snooze button.
